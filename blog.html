       <h3> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>
           It was challenging to try to get everything to match up perfecty. I attempted to solve it by taking pixel measurments 
            another problem is I wanted to select the parent of something. I looked up and found a selector called :has()
        </p>
<h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
<p>
            I relearned my reasoning for why I dont like web development which is getting the page to look a certain way. I also leanred about the :has() selector.
        </p>
<h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
<p>
            The biggest resource I use was the in class code that I have been updating since class one, as well as the internet where I learned about the :has()selector  which I leaned about from this website 
    <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/"> css has pseudo class. </a>
        </p>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>The only thing I had to google was how to select a parent which was the :has pseudo class that I have talked about this whole blog</p>
