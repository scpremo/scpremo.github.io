            <h3>What did you lear, what did you already know?</h3>
            <p>
                I learned how to upload to gitpages, besides that I knew everything
            </p>
            <h2>
                what resources were most helpful?
            </h2>

            <h3> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve
                those problems?</h3>
            <p>
                It was challenging to try to get everything to match up perfecty. I attempted to solve it by taking pixel
                measurments
                    another problem is I wanted to select the parent of something. I looked up and found a selector called :has()
                </p>
            <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you
                already knew?</h3>
            <p>
                I relearned my reasoning for why I dont like web development which is getting the page to look a certain way. I
                also leanred about the :has() selector.
            </p>
            <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class
                Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest resource I use was the in class code that I have been updating since class one, as well as the
                internet where I learned about the :has()selector which I leaned about from this website
                <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/"> css has pseudo class. </a>
            </p>
            <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
            <p>The only thing I had to google was how to select a parent which was the :has pseudo class that I have talked
                about this whole blog</p>
